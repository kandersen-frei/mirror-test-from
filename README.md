# mirror-test-from
This is a test repository used to test migration of a GitHub repository to a GitLab repository.

The steps are as follows:
1. Create dummy repo in GitHub (private account)
2. Add commits, deleted branches, and un-merged branches.
3. Mirror the repository to GitLab (private account)
4. Create commits in GitLab and merge them
5. Create new commits in GitHub repo and merge them
6. Fetch updates and sync GitLab commits on top of GitHub commits. Then push to GitLab.

This Update was written as part of step 2.

This update is part of step 2 and is the unmerged branch

This commit was created on the old repo after mirroring.
